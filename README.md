# ARTFLOW

## A Fast, Biologically Inspired Neural Network That Learns Optic Flow Templates for Self-Motion Estimation

Code for Layton, OW. ARTFLOW: A Fast, Biologically Inspired Neural Network That Learns Optic Flow Templates for Self-Motion Estimation. *Sensors*. 2021.

## Notes

1. `simulateModel.m` trains the neural network on the provided 3D dot cloud (T) dataset and predicts heading on the test set.
2. MATLAB R2021b is required to run the code.
